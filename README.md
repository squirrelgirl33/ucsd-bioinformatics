Stepik Material

These are my working materials for https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-analysis and https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioinformatics

The material between the two is overall similar, but Bioinformatics_Course1.py is a much more cleaned up version of everything with better explanations.
